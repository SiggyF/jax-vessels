# Verification Matrix

The `scripts/run_matrix.sh` script provides a flexible way to generate and run verification cases derived from the `floating_hull` template. It uses a matrix of options to configure the physics and load conditions.

## Usage

```bash
./scripts/run_docker.sh ./scripts/run_matrix.sh [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Flag | Values | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--waves` | `still`, `solitary` | **Wave Condition**. Controls the initial water surface configuration. |
| `--motion` | `static`, `6dof` | **Body Motion**. Controls whether the hull is fixed or free to move. |
| `--load` | `container`, `empty` | **Mass Properties**. (Only active for `6dof`). Toggles between container-loaded and empty hull mass/inertia. |

## Terminology

### Solitary Wave
The `solitary` wave option simulates a single wave generated by the collapse of a rectangular block of water, formerly referred to as "dam break".

In `setFields.waves`, a rectangular block of water is initialized above the still water level at the inlet:
```
box ( -100 -150 0 ) ( -80 150 10 );
```
When the simulation starts, this block of water "collapses" under gravity, generating a solitary wave that propagates down the tank. This is a robust method for generating impulsive waves without complex boundary conditions.

### Load Cases
- **Empty**: Baseline mass (~2.01M kg). Represents the hull without cargo.
- **Container**: Increased mass (~2.04M kg) and adjusted center of mass. Represents the hull with a standard container load. This case has been identified as prone to numerical instability.
