# OpenFOAM Still Water Test Case

This directory contains the template files for the "Still Water" verification case.

## Case Description

This is the simplest test case in the hierarchy. It consists of a rectangular domain filled partially with water and partially with air. Both fluids are initially at rest.

**Objective:** Verify hydrostatic stability and phase conservation.
*   **Hydrostatic Stability:** The velocity field `U` should remain negligible (near zero) over time. Any significant velocity indicates spurious currents often caused by imbalance between pressure gradient and gravity in the numerical scheme.
*   **Phase Conservation:** The water level (defined by `alpha.water`) should remain constant.

## Geometry and Mesh

*   **Domain:** Rectangular box defined in [system/blockMeshDict](../../templates/still_water/system/blockMeshDict).
*   **Mesh:** Simple structured hex mesh generated by `blockMesh`. No `snappyHexMesh` is used.
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   `minX`, `maxX`, `minY`, `maxY`: `symmetry` or `slip` walls to simulate an infinite tank.
    *   `minZ` (Bottom): `wall` or `symmetry`.
    *   `maxZ` (Top): `patch` (atmosphere).

## Key Physics

*   **Solver:** `interFoam` (Solver for 2 incompressible, isothermal immiscible fluids using a VOF phase-fraction based interface capturing approach).
*   **Turbulence:** Off (Laminar or essentially inviscid for this static test).
*   **Gravity:** $g = -9.81 m/s^2$ in the Z direction.

## Configuration Details

### [0/](../../templates/still_water/0/) (Initial Conditions)
*   **`alpha.water`**: Initialized using `setFields` to define the water level.
*   **`p_rgh`**: Static pressure profile ($p = \rho g h$).
*   **`U`**: Initialized to uniform $(0\ 0\ 0)$.

### [system/](../../templates/still_water/system/)
*   **[controlDict](../../templates/still_water/system/controlDict)**: Short duration simulation (e.g., 5-10 seconds) is usually sufficient to check for instability.
*   **[fvSchemes](../../templates/still_water/system/fvSchemes)**: Standard VOF schemes. `div(phi,alpha)` uses `vanLeer` or similar TVD scheme for interface sharpness.

## Verification Criteria

1.  **Max Velocity**: $U_{max} < 10^{-3} m/s$ (after initial transients settle).
2.  **Interface Smearing**: The interface thickness (transition from alpha 0 to 1) should not grow significantly.
