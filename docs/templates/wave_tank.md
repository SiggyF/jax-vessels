# OpenFOAM Wave Tank Test Case

This directory contains the template files for the "Wave Tank" verification case.

## Case Description

This case simulates a simple wave tank to verify the momentum advection and interface capturing capabilities of the setup under dynamic conditions.

**Objective:** Verify wave propagation and interface transport.
*   **Wave Propagation:** A wave (initialized via `setFields` as a dam break or solitary wave, or generated at the inlet) should propagate through the domain.
*   **Momentum:** The solver must correctly advect momentum with the wave.

## Geometry and Mesh

*   **Domain:** Long rectangular channel.
*   **Mesh:** Structured hex mesh generated by `blockMesh` ([system/blockMeshDict](../../templates/wave_tank/system/blockMeshDict)).
*   **Boundaries:**
    *   `inlet`: Can be a static wall (for dam break) or a wave generation patch.
    *   `outlet`: Outflow or wall.
    *   `sides`: Symmetry.
    *   `bottom`: Wall.
    *   `top`: Atmosphere.

## Key Physics

*   **Solver:** `interFoam`.
*   **Turbulence:** Laminar or low-Re turbulence (depending on setup).
*   **Free Surface:** Dynamic, capturing the wave form.

## Configuration Details

### [0/](../../templates/wave_tank/0/) (Initial Conditions)
*   **`alpha.water`**: Often initialized with a step function (dam break) or a specific wave profile.
*   **`U`**: May be initialized with a velocity field corresponding to the wave theory.

## Verification Criteria

1.  **Wave Speed**: The wave crest should travel at the theoretical group velocity $c = \sqrt{gh}$ (shallow water) or dispersion relation speed.
2.  **Conservation**: Mass should be conserved (check global `alpha.water` sum).
