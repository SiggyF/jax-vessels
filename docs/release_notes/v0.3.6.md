Release v0.3.6: Optimized Wigley Hull Workflow

**Improvements**
*   **Parallel Simulation**: Enabled 6-core parallel execution with `mpirun` for `interFoam`, significantly reducing simulation time.
*   **Physics Correction**: Implemented exact displacement calculation in `verify_hull.py` (clipping at design draft) to ensure neutral buoyancy at initialization. This resolves the "Rocket Launch" startup instability.
*   **Process Control**: Added `scripts/utils/stop_simulation.sh` for robust termination of Snakemake, Python, and Docker processes.
*   **Monitoring**: Added `6dof.csv` export to `monitor_floating.py` and enabled `reportToFile` in OpenFOAM.
*   **Documentation**: Verified and documented the Wigley hull workflow.
